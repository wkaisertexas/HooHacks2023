# Millenium Power 

> If you have any feedback, post it in the discussions section.

**Millenium Power** was our [HooHacks 2023](https://hoohacks.io) submission in the *Sustainability* track. Of interest to us was:

> "As the world adapts to newer technologies, how can we prevent efforts against sustainability?" 

As a team, we were concerned with uniformed, often politicized opinions on the use of renewable energy in the eletricity grid. Someone which has lead to signficiant backlash. 

This, combined with an inspriation from Bloomberg's [American Mall](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/american-mall-game/) lead us to come up with *Millenium Power*. 

The goal of *Millenium Power* was to teach two things: the difficulty of power grid management and the value a diverse range of renewable energies can have on stablizing the power grid. Doing so through an interative experience.

## Scenario

**You** are the grid mangager of tinyville, a small town challenged with managing the power grid for a rapidly growing town at the start of the new millenium (2000 CE) to the present.

This town wants many things: cheap, reliable power and a high quality of life through low pollution.

You are given a vast array of technologies at your disposal: **solar**, **wind**, **nuclear**, **coal**, **natural gas**, **hydroeletric** and **geothermal**.What you decide to use is up to you.

In total, the game is expected to take 15 minutes for a complete playthrough. This could be signficiantly shorter depending on whether or not

## **Design Principles**

Like **, *Millenium Power* is designed as a chaotic experience for the player. 

A crippling number of choices to make. An unending stream of citizens all too eager to make complaints. A growing town with rapidly changing energy needs all serve to make the game chatotic. A clear parallel to the intentionally depressing outcome of American mall: Amazon's takeover. 

This hopefullness is integration to both *[American Mall](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/american-mall-game/)* and *Millenium Power*. Upon this, the foundational lesson that: structural economic reasons are the primary driver behind decisions made. 

## **Technology Stack**

The project uses **NextJS** hosted on **FireBase**. Styling is done through **TailwindCSS** and the game is rendered through CSS grid. 

For those apt to assert that **React** is not a game engine. You are correct. This project is very poorly optimized and requires 50% of my M2 MacBook's CPU.

One of the primary goals for *Millenium Power* was balancing accuracy with engagment. We tired very had to maintain accuracy. 

However, this project was still built over the span of a 24-hour hackathon so omissions did take place.

If you have expertise in this area and think some of the simplifications made were unreasonably, feel free to leave an issue on this repository and we will be sure to evaluate it.
